**Mileage Prediction Regression Analysis**
This project demonstrates the use of regression techniques to predict vehicle mileage (miles per gallon - MPG) based on various features. The analysis is performed using Python and Jupyter notebooks, leveraging popular data science libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib for data processing, modeling, and visualization.

**Project Overview**
The primary goal of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of predicting the mileage of a vehicle based on its specifications. This involves analyzing and preparing the dataset, applying regression techniques, and evaluating the model's performance.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this analysis contains various vehicle attributes such as:

Cylinders
Displacement
Horsepower
Weight
Acceleration
Model year
Origin
The target variable for prediction is the vehicle's MPG (miles per gallon).

README.md: Project overview and documentation (this file).

**Models Used**
This project explores various regression models to predict vehicle mileage:

Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
The performance of these models is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as R², Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).


**Results**
The results from the analysis will vary depending on the specific model used and its parameters. Key results include:

Model performance comparison using metrics like R² score, MSE, and MAE.
Visualizations of actual vs predicted values.
